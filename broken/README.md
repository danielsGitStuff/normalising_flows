# Does this stuff work?
All these classes are kind of leftover, which did not make it into the final work and which are too good to be thrown away.
`ClassOneHot` should work though I did not test it within the whole framework. It is referenced by other classes but never used in any computations regarding MAFs.
`DS` is an old implementation of the current `DS` class for compatibility reasons.
The MNIST and HepMass stuff are other experiments which you may be interested to run, but I did not update them for a longer time, so they likely are broken.
